1. More effects

- auto-wah
- envelope follower
- better reverb (more features, use nested allpasses, use 1-pole 
  1-zero allpass instead of fractional delays)
- dynamic processing
- distortion?

2. Some instruments

- update and merge the old electric organ thingy
- some virtual analogue thing

3. DSP library

- profiling framework
- optimized code (the one I have now only pretends to be optimized :) )
- underflow handling

4. Wrappers

- LADSPA: proper rdf
- better jack host (controls etc)
- BSE
- buzztard
- Linux VST
- LV2

5. Organization stuff (autotools etc)

- correct compilation and installation of LADSPA plugins (current version is a hack!)
- switch to -O3
- get to work on 64-bit architectures
