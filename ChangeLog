Version 0.0.9

+ started creating an XML-based GUI (for monosynth only in this version)
+ LineGraph: new GTK+ control for displaying waveforms and filter response
graphs in Monosynth (and maybe others in future)
+ Monosynth: notch filter changes (made notch bandwidth proportional to Q,
just for fun, might be a bad idea)
+ Monosynth: more waves
+ Monosynth: capped Sustain level to 0.999 so that decay time actually means
something with Sustain = 100% (not a great way to do it, but acceptable in
this case)
+ autotools configuration update (detect Cairo and require newer GTK+)
+ Knob: new GTK+ control based on GtkRange, with my primitive bitmap set
(generated with Python and Cairo)
+ Organ: added a GUI too, very provisional
+ new effect: Rotary Speaker (split off Organ)
+ denormal fixes
