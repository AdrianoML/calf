Version 0.0.12
+ RotarySpeaker: temporarily broken
+ Organ: reworked to add a complete subtractive synth section and lots of
  other very nice features
+ Added crappy incomplete implementation of LV2 (including GUI and events,
  until they get changed again ;) )
+ Lots of small "polishing" kind of fixes in many places (like proper
  rounding of values in the GUIs, another set of hold/sostenuto fixes etc)

Version 0.0.11

+ Fixed x86-64 bugs
+ JackHost: implemented LASH support
+ RotarySpeaker: fixed panning bug, implemented acceleration/decceleration
  for "off" state

Version 0.0.10

+ First attempt at DSSI GUI, does not support some features from JACK host,
  but that's inevitable because of API limitations
+ Reverb: improvements (more parameters, fixed denormals)
+ Knob: added custom support for scroll wheel (instead of one inherited from
  GtkRange)

Version 0.0.9

+ started creating an XML-based GUI
+ LineGraph: new GTK+ control for displaying waveforms and filter response
  graphs in Monosynth (and maybe others in future)
+ Monosynth: notch filter changes (made notch bandwidth proportional to Q,
  just for fun, might be a bad idea)
+ Monosynth: more waveforms (these might be final?)
+ Monosynth: capped Sustain level to 0.999 so that decay time actually means
  something with Sustain = 100% (not a great way to do it, but acceptable in
  this case)
+ Monosynth: GUI refreshes less often (which means less CPU use)
+ Monosynth: less clicks on sounds using LP filter with very low cutoff 
  (using ramp of 256 samples instead of 64 samples as before)
+ Knob: new GTK+ control based on GtkRange, with my primitive bitmap set
  (generated with Python and Cairo)
+ Organ: added a GUI too, very provisional
+ Organ: fixed Hold pedal (doesn't release the notes which are still depressed)
+ RotarySpeaker: new effect (split off Organ)
+ all: denormal fixes (still some denormals present in reverb)
+ Reverb: better time setting (decay time somewhat corresponds to -60dB
  attenuation time)
+ JackHost: -M switch allows for automatic connection to JACK MIDI event source
  (use -M system:midi_capture_2 or -M 2 for autoconnection to
  system:midi_capture_2; of course, the short numeric form only work for
  system:midi_capture_ ports)
+ JackHost: -p switch selects a preset automatically
+ JackHost: better size setting algorithm
+ JackHost: duplicate client name (causing JACK to rename the client) doesn't
  break autoconnecting functionality
+ autotools configuration update (detect Cairo and require newer GTK+)
+ more presets
