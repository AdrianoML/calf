            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                Transient Designer is used to modify the envelope of percussive signals (signals with a defined attack or transient) like drum sounds, percussion instruments or even a recording of a single trumpet. It is able to remove or to boost the attack or the release of a signal independent from its real gain in contrast to the operation of compressors or expanders.
                The Calf Transient Designer is able to add a defined sustain phase to the signal.

            <h2>Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input (knob):</strong> Raise the volume before the signal is sent in the compression stage. If you have found some great settings but want to raise the overall loudness of the track simply increase this level.</li>
                <li><strong>Input L/R (VU-meter):</strong> The level of the original signal</li>
                <li><strong>0dB (LED):</strong> Flashes if the level of the original signal raises above 0dB (it doesn't clip your signal)</li>
                <li><strong>Bypass:</strong> Don't process anything, just bypass the signal</li>
                <li><strong>Mix:</strong> Decide how much of the processed signal should be mixed into the original signal</li>
                <li><strong>Output L/R (VU-meter):</strong> The level of the compressed and made up signal</li>
                <li><strong>0dB (LED):</strong> Flashes if the level of the output signal raises above 0dB (it may clip your signal depending on your host and your systems' bitrate!)</li>
                <li><strong>Output (knob):</strong> Raise the overall volume after the compression stage</li>
                <li><strong>Attack Time:</strong> This knob sets the duration of the attack phase. Technically it means that the attack curve reaches estimated 70.7% of the top of the actual signal (the envelope curve at that point to be more precisely) after the adjusted time.
                <li><strong>Attack Boost:</strong> Set the gain reduction or amplification in the attack phase. The more the attack curve differs from the actual signal (the envelope curve to be more precisely) the more the boost factor will alter the signal</li>
                <li><strong>Release Time:</strong> This knob sets the duration of the release phase (after the sustain phase). Technically it means that the release curve reaches estimated 29.3% of the difference between the actual signal (the envelope curve at that point to be more precisely) and the release curve after the adjusted time.
                <li><strong>Release Boost:</strong> Set the gain reduction or amplification in the release and sustain phase. The more the release curve differs from the actual signal (the envelope curve to be more precisely) the more the boost factor will alter the signal</li>
                <li><strong>Sustain Threshold:</strong> The release phase starts after the sustain phase has ended. The release phase starts after the original signal falls below the threshold level of the highest peak inside the transient</li>
                <li><strong>Display:</strong> Sets the amount of time to be displayed in the graph</li>
                <li><strong>Display Threshold:</strong> If this threshold is above -inf the curve is hold some milliseconds before a transient of the actual threshold value appears.
